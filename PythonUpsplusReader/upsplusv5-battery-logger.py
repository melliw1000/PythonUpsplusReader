UPSplus v5 Battery Logger V1.1
Original author: Ed Watson (mail@edwilldesign.com)
Contributors: leandroalbero

Logs uptime, battery voltage, device wattage and battery %remaining from the
GeeekPi UPSv5 (EP-0136) board, connected to a Raspberry Pi,and writes to a
timestamped CSV file for optional graphing via Pandas (if installed).

Usage original:
'python3 upspv5-batt-logger.py' - logs to local [timestamp].csv file
'python3 upspv5-batt-logger.py file.csv "[label for graph title]"' - graph results as local png images

Usage now:
'python3 upspv5-batt-logger.py --csvfile="[path to file.csv]" --runonce #both arguments are optional


Use to capture battery discharge profile. Run immediately after booting the device
following a full charge for best results. Recommend enabling 'Overlay FS' if using
RasPi Debian Buster to make the FS read-only w/ RAM disk. This prevents FS damage
when battery power becomes low, causing power outages. 

Note: "% remaining" is not accurate during charging.
